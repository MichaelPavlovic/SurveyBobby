# SurveyBobby  
  
**__Team: Curious Raccoons__**  
  
## :white_check_mark: Project Description  
  
The purpose of the website is to allow registered users to create their own surveys, and make them available for other registered users to fill. The survey creators input the Title, short description, and select category. Next, they input their questions that will appear on the surveys. Answer options to the surveys’ questions are standard for all surveys and autogenerated by the website, they are: “Strongly Disagree”, “Disagree”, “Neutral”, “Agree”, “Strongly Agree”. This structure will allow us to use algorithms to analyse customer satisfaction, or participation level (depending on the category) on a scale from 1 to 5.   The creators of the surveys will be able to see how many times the survey was filled by others, and see on the grade from 1 to 5 the average score amongst all survey results. 
Unregistered users will only be able to see the main/home page where they will find our logo, “Register” and “Login” buttons, information about our website and how it works, FAQs, and our contact information. In addition, they will see one “sample survey” accessible from the top navigation bar to give an idea how the survey looks like.

Registered users will be able to Log-in on the main page, and will be re-directed to their User Dashboard, where they will see a list of all surveys that they have created, and statistic associated with each survey. They will be able to follow the link to create new surveys from their dashboard.  As well as, able to go to the main page where, as registered users, they will see a list of all surveys available, and select one to fill if desire. In addition, from their dashboard they will be able to update their own profile, and even delete the account. 

Administrator following the Login will be re-directed to the Admin Dashboard, where they will be able to see “At Glance” information about all users in a system, and users registered in a last 30 days. Similarly, surveys information will be displayed including total surveys, and surveys created in a last 30 days. Also, administrator is able to see list of all surveys, where they will be able to remove them, and a list of all users registered with an option to delete the user form the system. From Admin dashboard, administrator will be able to access home page management page.
